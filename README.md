#### time-series-nmf  

`time-series-nmf` is a Python package implementing non-negative matrix factorization for time series data. Currently, it has implements a version with Tikhonov regularization and sparse constraints as proposed by [Fabregat R.. et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14576) and implemented in Matlab in [https://github.com/raimon-fa/palm-nmf]. It uses a [PALM](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0701-9) optimization scheme. We plan to add other models and optimization algorithms.
